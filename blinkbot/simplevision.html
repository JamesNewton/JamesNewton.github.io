 <P>Structured light vision techniques greatly simplify the process of triangulating the position of a point in space. 
   Using structured light techniques, one can do realtime navigation without lots of horsepower. 
   This is because one is able to project a beam with known coordinates. 
   This provides information about at least one aspect of the geometry in front of the camera, 
   so the triangulation equations are much easier and less computationally expensive.</P>

  <P>Structured light techniques are far superior to sonar for range and shape measurements in quality and potentially cheaper. 
    They are able to map out the region in front of the camera quickly and accurately. The angular resolution of structured light systems is quite good.
  They are also better than IR sensors because they are far more reliable, higher resolution, and easier to debug because they can be seen.
  </P>
  <P>The basic idea with structured light vision is to project a light beam of known geometry onto a scene and then use a video camera to observe how it is distorted by objects. 
    Using simple geometric formulas, one can reconstruct the shape of those objects. </P>
    
<P>There are several optical attachments to laser diodes which produce wide planes of laser light without any moving parts. 
  Additionally, one does not have to use a visible laser to perform the scan. 
  Most cameras will detect infrared laser beams quite well (some cameras are more sensitive to infrared light).</P>

<P>Here we see a self-scanning laser diode projecting a beam onto the region in front of it; above is the camera.</P>

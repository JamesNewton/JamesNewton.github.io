<P>
David Hampton knows what he would have done if his parents had presented
hirn with a Furby on his ninth birthday. "One, I'd take the fur off," said
Hampton, now 47, who invented the 5-inch gremlin in his California home last
year but who was willing, for the sake of a telephone interview, to transport
himself to the basement of his boyhood home near Detroit. aTwo, I'd open
up the case, the shell," he continued. Three, look at everything as it's
working&#151; that way I can see how everything is tied together. Four, I
would start disassembling the circuit board.
<P>
"And, if I really succeeded," he said, "I would put it all back together
and it would still work."
<P>
For those who have never had the pleasure of elbowing through Toys R us in
fruitless pursuit, the Furby is this season's "hit" toy: a cuddly&#151;some
would say cloying &#151;mechanized ball of synthetic hair that is part penguin,
part owl and part kitten. Furby has a synthesized 200-word vocabulary in
a language called Furbish and the ability to squeal if the lights go out,
snore and even sneeze. If the Pet Rock and Tickle Me Elmo had mated, in a
union sealed with a Mood Ring, they would have given birth to a Furby.
<P>
In fact, he or she&#151;the sex of the Furby is at the owner's
discretion&#151;came from the imagination of Hampton, a perpetual inventor
of toys and medical products who lives with his wife and two young sons in
a home without electricity in the Tahoe National Forest. He won't name the
nearest town, which is 25 miles away, because he says he is afraid of frantic
parents' beating on his door demanding the plush companions, which have been
flying off store shelves and now fetch 10 times their suggested $30 retail
price on the Internet. 
<P>
Hampton pleads not guilty to stoking the marketing juggernaut that has engulfed
the Furby, which has been presided over by the company to which he licensed
the toy last year, Tiger Electronics of Vernon Hills, Ill. And even though
the estimated 2 million units sold have probably made him millions (he won't
say), his naivete is convincing. This, after all, is someone whose earliest
idea of a toy was a toaster waiting to be taken apart. Before he reached
puberty, he says, the basement of his family's whitebrick home in Roseville,
Mich., was littered with nearly a dozen broken radios belonging to
neighbors&#151;which he fixed, for a few dollars, sometimes at 4 a.m.

  Only the beginning

<P>
When he was 13, he began working in a little television repair shop. Not
long after that, he resurrected a World War II radar system (which wound
up jamming the local police frequency) and built a ham radio. "I had a neighbor
call and say, 'Are you WA8-JAD?' " he recalls. "My voice was coming out all
over the neighborhood telephones. "My brothers were playing with more traditional
toys," he says. "Me, I would much rather have a tube checker." Having read
in PopularElectronicsthat "the best electronics school was the Navy," Hampton
enlisted soon after graduating from high school in 1970. He chose aviation
electronics as his specialty. During his eight years in the service, he traveled
the world, learning Japanese, Thai, Chinese and Hebrew. His training led
to jobs in Silicon Valley, including one designing the video game Q-Bert
and another in product development for Mattel. In the early 1990s, he formed
his own design and consulting company, Sounds Amazing, and it was in that
capacity that he traveled to New York in February 1997 for the annual Toy
Fair trade show. There, he saw the interactive, digital pets known as Tamagotchi.
Though they exist on electronic screens no bigger than a watch, the toys
require their owners to feed them and clean up after them with the push of
a button, or they die.

  A better mousetrap

Hampton saw a fatal flaw: "You can't pet it." So he returned to his home
workshop and began writing about his ideal virtual pet, with the working
name Furball. "I started a script like, if you rub his back, he'll purr,'
Hampton said. He also gave Furby a language, an amalgam of all the languages
he had picked up. Thus when Furby says "da," he is using the Mandarin word
for "big." When he says, Ray lo," for bight," it is a variation of a Hebrew
word for God. Using a crude electronic board not unlike the Heathkits he
played with as a boy, Hampton brought Furby's scratchy voice to life. A former
colleague from Mattel, Caleb Chung, created the mechanics. By November 1997,
Hampton had sold the idea to Tiger Electronics. By February, a crude model
was shown at the Toy Fair, tethered to a generator. In September, Wired magazine
endorsed Furby as the season's hottest new toy," and the toy industry was
on its way to having its next Beanie Baby. In an accolade that only the Internet
could bestow, one disgruntled owner has conducted an online autopsy of his
Furby (www.phobe.com/furby/), complete with a toe-tagged "crime scene photo."
<P>
"Frankly," the self-described scientist wrote, "we find him much more amusing
dead than he was alive." Hampton has seen the site. "My first thought was,
'That's what I would have done," he said. "The other side of me said: My
baby! They're dissecting my babies!' "

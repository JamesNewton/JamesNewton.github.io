  Personal Computer History
</H1>
<P>
1804 <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">Jacquard loom
</A>by Joseph Marie Jacquard is the first to use punched cards to direct
the machine. First "programming" job created.
<P>
1840's <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Chuck
Babbage</A> conceives of the "Analytical Engine", to be programmed by punch
card, and "Touring Complete" for the printing of mathematical tables.
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace </A>documents
it, publishes the first computer program, and <A HREF="hackers.htm">hacks</A>
the machine to show it could generate music and do other more interesting
things.
<P>
1922 <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth">Kathleen Booth</A>
writes the first assembly language, to change human readable instructions
into the numbers machines can execute.
<P>
1954 <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">John Backus</A>
leads a team at IBM to develop the first commercially available high level
language, FORTRAN: FORmula TRANslation. As the name implies, it focused on
math. At that time it was an "interpreted" language, meaning that each command
had machine code associated which was run when that command was recognized.
It was later converted to a compiler where the high level language is all
converted to low level machine code before running
<P>
1950's <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">"Amazing"
Grace_Hopper</A> writes the first linker (enabling programs to be written
in sections) and gives us the first general purpose computer language, COBOL:
COmmon Business Oriented Language and the first compiler. She is also known
for having coined the terms "bug" and "debugging" after finding a literal
bug (a moth) in an early electro-mechanical computer. (Not correct, but who cares? It's a distraction from her real accomplishments.) 
<P>
1958
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John
McCarthy</A> invents LISP: ( LISt Processor, ( which heavily influenced languages
( including the underlying engine of Javascript ) ) ).
<P>
1960's
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)">Margaret
Hamilton</A> (age 33) leads the software team for the Apollo II (first
landing on the moon) and saves that landing by insisting on the inclusion
of a process monitor to catch
overloads.<SUP><A HREF="https://hackaday.com/2018/04/10/margaret-hamilton-takes-software-engineering-to-the-moon-and-beyond/"
    title="Astronauts did not cause the issue. It was a random timeing problem.">1</A>
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer#PGNCS_trouble"
    title="Fails to mention that Hamilton was the one who insisted that Lancombs code be included."
    >2</A></SUP> She is the first to advocate for software development to be
considered a profession.
<P>
1970's <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee
</A>invents the World Wide Web. Four women solved the problems required
to make it actually work. 
<UL>
<LI><A href="https://www.ha.co.nz/blog/ginny-strazisar-travers">Virginia (Ginny) Strazisar Travers</a> made the first "gateway" router to connect between local networks, 
<LI><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman">Radia_Perlman</A> figured out how to automatically generate routes,

guided the development of ARPANET, whois, DNS, RFC's and other infrastructure
which became the modern internet.

<P>
1970's "<A HREF="language/smalltalk/index.htm">SmallTalk</A>" a message based,
object oriented programming language is developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay,
Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others.
<P>
1972-73 The <A HREF="language/ccpp/index.htm">C Programming Language</A> is developed by Dennis Ritchie, and documented by Brian Kernighan along with Ritchie in 1978. The C language is used to write most computer languages, as it has been implemented for most systems and results in fast, efficient, code, given a bit more work on the part of the programmer that higher level languages.
<P>
1995 "<A HREF="language/java/script/index.htm">Javascript</A>" (which is
not Java) is added to Netscape Navigator (which later grows to become FireFox).
It is based on Scheme (based on LISP), Self (based on SmallTalk), and only
looks like Java. Sort of. Originally interpreted, it is now JIT (Just In
Time) compiled.
<P>
Note: You may have noticed a surprising number of women making significant
advances, especially in the very early days of programming: First program,
first assembly language, first compiled language, saving the Apollo landing,
fixing the net, etc... If you are surprised, it is because women are very
much ignored and written out of history. We throw away half our brain power
by doing that. Read about
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">Women in
Computing</A> and support girls / women in tech jobs if you want our country
to excel.
<P>
Did you know? Hedy Lamarr co-invented spread spectrum modulation during WWII.
...and yes, that is the absolute truth. She had no great technical ability,
but when the problem of radar and radio jamming was explained to her, she
suggested changeing the frequency according to a preset pattern (like a song)
to keep the Germans guessing. Her fresh point of view made the difference.

When personal computers came out, and reached a low enough price to be marketed as toys, they were primarily seen as educational opportunities. Companies recognized that parents at the time were more likely to invest in the education of their male children, so the marketing targeted boys <i>exclusively</i>. As a result, when girls grew to young women and started classes on computing in college, they had a massive disadvantage; they had never played with home computers.<!-- 44493.4482060185 EOR -->

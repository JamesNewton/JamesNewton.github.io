Given an environment which is fixed, actors in that environment with a variety of possible attributes or behaviors, and some goal or desired outcome: Observe a population of actors, evaluate them according to how well they perform, and spawn new actors whose characteristics are based on those who performed the best.</A>

The sequence is:
<UL>
<LI><b>Initial population</b>: A population is generated from individuals with attribute parameters.
<LI><b>Observation</b>: The population interacts with the environment and data is collected about their ending state.
<LI><b>Fitness function</b>: The observations are graded in comparison to the desired outcome.
<LI><b>Selection</b>: Those individuals who performed best are selected.
<LI><b>Crossover</b>: Groups of selected individuals exchange some random set of attributes.
<LI><b>Mutation</b>: Random changes are introduced to avoid local minimum and ensure diversity.
</UL>
This process is then repeated for many generations.</A>

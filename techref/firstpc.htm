   <h1><a href="history.htm">History</a>: The First Personal Computer</h1>
<P>
Let's refresh: (1) the personal computer was invented by Id Apple; (2) the
personal computer was invented by IBM; (3) the personal computer was invented
by Bill Gates. Now let's get this straight: These are myths propagated by
the respective companies or through industry ignorance. There's an old saying:
When you forget history, you are doomed to have it repeat itself. 
<P>
The first PC was actually a French machine called the Micral (from R2E in
1973), which was never really a player in the market, especially not in the
United States. The Altair computer, from a small New Mexico-based company
called Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems (MITS), fueled the PC industry.
This machine dominated the industry from 1975, when the system first appeared
on the cover of Popular Electronics (then a ZiffDavis publication), to 1978.
More important, the Altair and MITS set the stage for everything from giant
trade shows to faster processors to bloated code to the magazine you're reading.
It also gave Gates the business model he needed to become the world's richest
man. 
<P>
The classic MITS Altair history credits Les Solomon, the technical editor
of Popular Electronics, with challenging his friend Ed Roberts, owner of
MITS, to build a small computer kit, because he'd been seeing a lot of plans
for such devices in 1974. The Intel 8008 processor had excited a lot of
engineers, and many knew that it was the core of a computer waiting to happen.
<P>
Roberts started off selling radio transmitters for model airplanes and began
selling calculator kits for electronics hobbyists, but the latter business
was destroyed by Texas Instruments' inexpensive calculator, introduced in
1972. By 1974, Roberts' idea of upgrading the calculator kit to a computer
kit met with Solomon's encouragement, and the Altair (the name a reference
to "Star Trek") was born. 
<P>
PC BY DESIGN 
<P>
The machine was designed after a minicomputer, with a bus with 18 slots,
a motherboardF and a front panel. The bus was called the Altair bus, which
later became the S-100 bus, and which even later became the IEEE bus still
in use today. The components were sacked, and the whole computer sold for
$397 in kit form. Two computer-store chains cropped up within a year. Computer
Kits sold the Altair exclusively, and its competition, the Byte Shop, sold
everything it could. 
<P>
The original Altair used the Intel 8080 chip released in 1974, but it was
misnamed the Altair 8800. It had a meager Z56 bytes of main memory and a
front panel consisting of toggle switches and LEDs There was no onerating
svstem, programming language, or terminal. People had to toggle in machine
instnuctions to get the computer to do anything. This, of course, assumed
the machine worked in the first place&#151;users had to handsolder the thing
together But thousands flocked to buy the kits. 
<P>
Immediately, Paul Allen and Gates, fnends who were both in the Boston area
at the time, came up with the idea of putting a programming language together
and selling it to Roberts. Apparently, Roberts was getting a lot of proposals
and was skeptical as he demanded to see nunning code. Gates and Allen flew
to Albuquerque to show off a BASIC interpreter they "threw together" as fast
as they could. Accounts vary as to what this first iteration of BASIC actually
did, but it's assumed that it didn't do much more than run a greeting message.
Allen was immediately given the title of director of software development
for the company. Gates went back to Harvard but soon returned to New Mexico
to write code for the Altair. 
<P>
CODE BLOAT 
<P>
When the little BASIC compiler was finished, it required 4,096 bytes of memory,
but the machine had only 256 bytes the first code bloat in PC history. So
Allen, along with some of the MITS engineers, set out to design a memory
card for the Altair, the famous 4K card. Allen was a software designer, and
therefore the result was a disaster. This card, now a collector's item, never
worked. But it allowed other companies to enter the business with cards that
did work. The third-party vendor movement was the result. 
<P>
BASIC was the rage among Altair users who managed to get enough memory into
the machine. Within two years of the introduction of the Altair, computer
clubs became a rampant phenomenon. Much of the credit for the ancillary aspects
of this computer revolution belongs to MITS employee David Bunnell, who is
seldom acknowl edged for his seminal role as a marketeer. He essentially
invented the computer show and the computer magazine, and might even tied
to computer stores and computer clubs. He went on to found PC Magazine years
later as the industry begain to repeat itself.
<P>
Meanwhile, because the 4K boards did not work and Roberts had only sold BASIC
with the 4K boards, hobbyists were copying BASIC to run on other 4K cards,
namely ones from Processor Technology. This was the era when Gates showed
up at the Homebrew Computer Club to complain about bootlegging. While most
hobbyists freely swapped programs and code, Gates would have none of it.
There was money to be made, and he was giving nothing away. I'm convinced
that Microsoft's recent giveaway of Internet Explorer pains him.
<P>
The code that Gates conplained about was on Paper tape, and paper-tape readers
were used for a short period to move BASIC on and off the computer later,
casette decks would be used, but something faster and more reliable was needed.
IBM had already iritroduced the 5 inch floppy disk, and the engineers at
MITS decided these disks would be ideal for their computers. Soon the 8-inch
floppy was incorporated into MITS machines, and the trend toward application
bbat could begin. 
<P>
MITS started having quake control problems as well as management difficulties,
as Roberls was not cut out for this much action. To further complicate things,
Allen and Gates were starting Microsoft on the side. They both left in 1976.
By May 1977, there was port d real competition from all sides. IMSAI was
selling a direct clone ofthe Altair, and many people preferred it. It was
also made in Silicon Valley, where the hobbyists lived, not in New Mexico.
The SOL computer appeared, as well as RadioShack and Commodore machines.
The Apple II also made its debuted. 
<P>
Roberts sold his company to Pertec for $12 million and gave up on the business.
He moved to Georgia where he became a country doctor, something he had really
wanted to do from the beginning. Pertec expected to get all the rights to
BASIC for its troubles and found itself in court with Allen and Gates, who
were given their rights to the code. Gates learned a lesson and made sure
he had all the rights to DOS later when he sold it to IBM on a nonexclusive
basis. 
<P>
When you look deep into the story of the Altair, you see the entire history
of desktop computing. Everything that happens today is reflected in there
somewhere. Within two years after selling the Altair brand name to Pertec,
the company - dropped it, and it is now forgotten, as is Pertec itself another
example of how being first does not necessarily ensure long-term success.

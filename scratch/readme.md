### Developming Games on Scratch

#### Expectations: 

- Programming is hard. You aren't going to learn to make award winning games in one class. It's a complex and difficult goal with a cost. Your attention and effort here is where you start paying. Then hours spent looking at others programs and trying out ideas are the next payment. Along the way, you will learn things that will make you a better programmer, and maybe have fun doing it. Scratch is actually a great way to learn how to be a good programmer.

- Scratch has limitations. It doesn't have a real 3D engine. Although it's a great place to [learn how 3D works](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/How_to_Make_a_Three-Dimensional_Project). It's also not terribly efficient and can be a bit slow, especially on older computers. And people don't take it seriously sometimes. But they should.

- Writing good games requires understanding gamers. Just knowing you like a game or don't isn't enough. You have to understand WHY. You need to understand what makes a game interesting or boring. This class should help a bit with that.

- Your instructor is NOT a game programmer, or a gamer, or a scratch programmer. So why is he teaching this class? Years of experience programming, did contracted work for several large games, stopped playing computer games when he realized that "reality" is a game.

In this class, you will learn to use Scratch, see how to look behind the hood at the program that makes the game work, learn the basics of Scratch programming by building a simple game yourself. Hopefully you will be inspired to continue learning on your own. 

#### Examples. 
Would you like to play a game? We will start out by playing a few games in scratch. Just a couple minutes for each game, then we will stop and talk about it for a minute or two, before moving on to the next game.

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/259993708/ Basically Super Mario. Check inside to see how that game works. Very complex. But... it's exposed for you to learn! Notice how smaller sections work together. See how each sprite has it's own code, costumes, and sounds. 
- The code controls how that sprite reacts. (zoom out with the - lower right to see as much as possible, scroll around) Events can start a block of code, or a block can start (call) another block. Or you can trigger a block by clicking on it (e.g. center of code for "Player", define reset reload). The stage also has code. 

- The costumes control how the sprite appears. Sequences of costumes animate the sprite.

- Sounds allow a sprite to make noise. You can play them, upload new ones, or if your mic works, record your own.

you can do 3D, but it's not easy. 
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27623362/ there are other engines that make 3D easier.
A good story line, some simple effects, and puzzles make good games.
